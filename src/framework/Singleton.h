    class Foo : public Ember::Singleton<Foo>

    In your implementation you're then required to intialize ms_Singleton to 0, such as this

    Whenever you need the singleton instance in your project you can then get it by calling @see getSingleton() or @see getSingletonPtr()
    Note that you still have to provide lifetime service and ownership and need to both create and destroy the instance where appropriate.
