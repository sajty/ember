 * This is the base unit for representing an Eris::View instance graphically in the Ogre component of EmberOgre.
 * An instance of this is created when an Eris::View instance is available, and destroyed along with it. It's responsibility is to handle the Ogre scene (along with a main camera, movement controllers etc.).

 The initialization will occur when either the sight queue is empty, or a certain time has elapsed.
 The main reason for doing this is that whenever a new area is added to the world, the foliage is invalidated and reloaded.
 As a result when the user first enters the world and is getting sent all the surrounding entities, there's a great chance that some of these entities will be areas. If the foliage then already has been initialized it will lead to the foliage being reloaded a couple of time.
 By delaying the loading of the foliage we can avoid this.
