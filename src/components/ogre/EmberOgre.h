/**
 @brief The main class of the Ogre rendering component. This functions as a hub for almost all subsystems used when rendering the world.

 This is the central class for the whole Ogre related part of Ember. It's quite large and could perhaps be refactored into smaller parts though.
 It holds references to most subcomponents, and is instantiated at the start of Ember. A lot of different signals from different subsystems are routed through here. If you're not sure how to get access to a certain subsystem from another unrelated class, this is probably the first place you should look.

 It's a singleton so you can access it through
 @code
 OgreView::EmberOgre::getSingleton()
