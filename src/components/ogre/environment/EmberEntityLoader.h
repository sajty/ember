@brief A simple struct for storing an entity instance.

* The position is needed for updating the paged geometry when the position of the entity changes, since we need to update the page both at the entity's previous position as well as the page in the new position.
* The connections are useful for disconnecting the listeners when we're not listening to the entity anymore (i.e. when it's been removed from the world).

	@author Erik Hjortsberg <erik.hjortsberg@gmail.com>
	@brief A specialized implementation of Forests::PageLoader used for positioning instances of ModelRepresentation

	This acts like a bridge between the Ember and the PagedGeometry systems, allowing ModelRepresentation instances from the former being represented in the latter. Entities that are handled by this will be graphically represented through the PagedGeometry engine, rather than by using instances of Model. The class will take care of listening to movement updates and deletions from the entity, automatically updating the paged geometry when the entity changes.


	Use addEmberEntity to add entities, and removeEmberEntity to remove them.

	The storage of entities can either use a straight up map, or use batches, where each batch corresponds to a page in the paged geometry. The latter is more efficient when generating the pages needed by the paged geometry engine, but requires more memory and is less effective when adding or removing entities. The batching can be turned on and off through the EMBERENTITYLOADER_USEBATCH define.
