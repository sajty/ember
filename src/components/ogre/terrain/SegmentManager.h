/**
 * @author Erik Hjortsberg <erik.hjortsberg@gmail.com>
 * @brief Manages all Segment instances.
 *
 * The Mercator terrain defines the terrain as a collection of separate Segment instances. Each segment is a quadratic area of terrain, under normal circumstances 64*64 world units.
 * These segments hold their own height map data, as well as any surfaces (grass, sand etc.) they might contain. With a very large terrain, the memory used by these intances might grow very large, and it's therefore prudent to release data for segments which aren't currently used.
 * The main issue with doing this is however that Mercator is inherently non-thread safe. Deleting data in a segment without knowing what other parts of the system might access it is therefore forbidden.
 * As Ember uses separate threads for all terrain handling we need a mechanism for keeping track of all segments which are used in the system, no matter in what thread they might be. The main responsibility of this manager is therefore to provide this functionality.
 *
 * The base class in the system is the Segment class, which is a wrapper around a Mercator::Segment. A subcomponent in Ember is forbidden to directly access Mercator::Segment instances from the Mercator::Terrain instance. They MUST go through this manager.
 * Each Mercator::Segment is matched against a Segment instance. As long as the Mercator::Segment instance exists there should also be a corresponding Segment instance. As this is a very lightweight class there should be no memory issue holding many in the system.
 * The Segment instances are references from the manager through instances of SegmentHolder. This is a SegmentManager insternal class who's sole responsibility is to keep a count of how many references there are to the Segment instance. When there are no active references the Segment is eligible for data release.
 * Whenever an external subsystem needs to access a segment it will need to call the getSegmentReference() method to obtain a reference instance. As long as the reference instance is alive the Segment is considered in use and will not be "collected".
 *
