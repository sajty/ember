// This is a template that describes a layout for header files.

// Additional guidelines:
//
// - The indent is tab
//
// - Opening braces on new lines
//
// - if's, while's etc always have a block with opening and closing brace,
// even if they just consist of one line.
//
// - Classes are always Capitalized for each word,
// methods start with lower caps for first word,
// upper caps for first letter of subsequent words.
//
// - Constants in ALL_CAPS with underscore between words.
//
// - No public variables are allowed, getter and setter methods are used instead.
//
// - Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables, avoid acronyms.
// See Ottinger's naming rules for more info:
// http://www.objectmentor.com/publications/naming.htm
//
// - Always return a value at the end of non-void functions.
//
// - To get a very similar style use the indent program with these options:
// indent -i4 -nbad -nbap -npsl -ut -ts4 -bli0 <sourcefile>
// [if you find better options then tell me. ]
//
// - Always pass strings as "const std::string&". This also applies to returning strings from methods if you are absolutely sure that the object won't go away soon.
//
// - If a value cannot be null, always prefer to pass it as reference instead of by pointer. That way there's a degree of inherent semantics, knowing that an object cannot be null.
//
// - Never use the C kind of casting, i.e. "(int)foo", instead always use the C++ version, i,e, "static_cast<int>(foo)". Any casts should stand out in the code directly; with the C style it's too easy to miss them.
//
// - Never use dynamic_cast unless it's absolutely, absolutely necessary. Use static_cast instead.
//
// - When documenting a class, member or field always use the @brief doxygen keyword first to provide a quick description. Always use full English sentences, i.e. with uppercase initial letter and a period on the end. See examples later on in this document.
//
// - If you're using Eclipse there's a coding style file available at EclipseCodeStyle.xml
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Doxygen supports todos
// EXAMPLE:
// /*
// * @todo I need to really learn to code at some point in time
// */
//
// "NOTE:" -is used similarily to TODO's, but is used to bring some detail
// to programmers attention that may be unintuitive or easy to miss otherwise,
// or some other meta-comment about the program (?).
//
// Some other syntax is used in some other parts of worldforge
// (something to do with % -characters, IIRC).   We could examine if this is suitable for us.
//
// "Fixme" is another todo type tag used sometimes.
//
// Whatever syntax we settle for, it would be nice to have scripts that can
// extract the todo notes from the code, order them according to importance,
// or some other parameter, and include them on a web page, with links
// back to the original code (in bonsai or some other web cvs system?
// Or at least file and line number otherwise).
//
